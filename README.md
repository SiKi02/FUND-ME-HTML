# FUND-ME-HTML

This code will interact with fund-me contract in my previous repository. This is my first app development

a. Connect: will connect to your metamask, if you don't have metamask installed it will throw an error that metamask needs to be installed.

b. getBalance: Will see the balance currently in the contract.

c. Withdraw: It will let the signer withdraw the balance from the contract into his own account.

d. Fund: User needs to input the balance to fund contract, metamask will pop up to sign transaction.

Looking for a more developed app in the future.
